To Do:
    - Fix all 'ToDo' in the code.
    - Verify that the elo system is working as expected
    - Implement a profile view, in which one can see more information about the person
        - currently only shows the match history
    - Implement statistics
        - win percentage
        - Most wins against
        - Most losses against
        - Graph with the time evolution of the elo
            - currently impossible, the database does not keep track of this info
            - may be more trouble than it's worth, but it would be nice
